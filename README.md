# Labelled Database Maker for Computer Vision

> The aim of this project was to create a labelled image dataset automatically, rather than by hand, that could be used to train a model for object detection and landmark recognition. This method is a work-around to creating a labelled image dataset by hand, which can be a very long and tedious process.

> This particular program generates images of playing cards on various backgrounds, with different positions and perspectives. It keeps track of the bounding box of the card positions as well as the four corner coordinates of the cards, so that images are automatically labelled when it comes time to train the model.   

## Results 

Here is a sample of the generated database :

These may not look like it, but they are generated images, not pictures taken by hand. You can have a look at [/Database](/Database) for a closer look at these, where you might detect some signs.
